Go based HTTP server with 2FA based on OTP (One-Time Password) manager like
Google Authenticator, etc.

The server contains the following end-points:
- `/authenticate` to authenticate user and return a valid JWT token via HTTP
  POST request
- `/verify-otp` performs OTP authentication with OTP provider (Google
  Authenticator) and return a valid OTP token 
- `/protected` provides authorized user access to protected data

For simplicity, the code uses hard-coded `12345` port, it stores user's
QR image and secret into `static/<user>` area.

You should install [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en_US&gl=US) or similar OTP authenticator
on your smart phone.

To build and run server just do the following:
```
# build server code
go build

# run server
./2fa-server
```

The data flow can be represented as following:
```
# Step 1: install Google Authenticator on your phone

# Step 2: visit our server to get QR code for specific user=UserName
# here code should be imporved to provide user's registration, so far
# any user name is accepted
http://localhost:12345/qr?user=UserName

# Step 3: scan QR code and open URL. It will add new entry into Google Authenticator
# now we are ready to use it with our app

# Step 4: get token
curl -X POST http://localhost:12345/authenticate
# it returns server token in JSON format
{"token":"eyJhb..."}

# Step 5: now visit Google Authenticator to obtain new code

# Step 6: authenticate with our server using OTP (One-Time Password) code
# obtained from a previous step
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:12345/verify-otp -d '{"otp":"383878"}'
# it returns new token from otp secure code generated by Google Authenticator
"eyJhbG..."

# Step 7: call protected API using new OTP token
otpToken="eyJhbG..."
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $otpToken" http://localhost:12345/protected
```
